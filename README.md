# Linux-Scripts
Various scripts for installing software.
Feel free to add or remove whatever you like from the script.

## Script 01
Script 1 downloads NordVPN, and sets up Flatpaks.
Then reboot's for changes to take effect.

## Script 02
Installs software from Flathub rather than using Snap's.
To search for software either use the online GUI (https://flathub.com/), or you can use the command "flatpak search [aplication name]" in the CLI of the terminal.
